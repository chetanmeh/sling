Apache Sling Context Aware Configuration
========================================

Apache Sling Context Aware Configuration is work-in-progress.

These bundles provide a service API that can be used to get context aware configurations. Context aware configurations are configurations that are related to a content resource or a resource tree, e.g. a web site or a tenant site.

1. Java API
===========

To get and use configurations, the Java API must be used. Any using code must not make any assumptions on how the context aware configurations are searched or stored!

1.1 Context Aware Resources
===========================

The base concept are context aware resources: for a given content resource, a named configuration resource can be get.
The service for getting the configuration resources is called the ConfigurationResourceResolver. This service has two methods:
- getting a named configuration resource
- getting all child resources of a named configuration resource.

For example to get a configuration resource for a content resource at /content/mysite/page1, you would write:

Resource pageResource = resourceResolver.getResource("/content/mysite/page1");

Resource configResource = configurationResourceResolver.getResource(pageResource, "site-configuration");

Or if you have several configuration resources of the same type and you need all of them:

Collection<Resource> configResources = configurationResourceResolver.getResourceCollection(pageResource, "socialmedia");

1.2 Context Aware Configurations
================================

While context aware resources give you pure resources and your application code can decide what to do with it,
the most common use case is some configuration. A configuration is usually described by a DTO like class, interface
or annotation (like Declarative Services does for component configurations). These are typed configuration objects
and the context aware configuration support automatically converts resources into the wanted configuration type.

Context aware configurations are built on top of context aware resources. The same concept is used: configurations are
named and the service to get them is the ConfigurationResolver. It has a single method to get a ConfigurationBuilder
and this builder can then be used to get configurations:

Resource pageResource = resourceResolver.getResource("/content/mysite/page1");

ConfigurationBuilder builder = configurationResolver.get(pageResource);

SiteConfiguration siteConfig = builder.as(SiteConfiguration.class);
Collection<SocialMediaConfig> configs = builder.name("socialmedia").asCollection(SocialMediaConfig.class);

2. Default Implementation
=========================

The above API is completely agnostic to the way context aware resources / configurations are searched and stored in the resource tree.
The following is how the default implementation in Apache Sling works:

2.1 Context Resolving
=====================

The first step is to find out to which context (e.g. site or tenant) a resource belongs. The mechanism starts at the given content resource
and looks for a property named "sling:config". It traverses up the resource hierarchy until either root os reached or such a property is found.
If no property is found, there are the following fallbacks which will be searched in the given order : "/config/global", "/apps", and "/libs".
These fallbacks are also used if a configuration resource is requested which does not exist in the given context.

For example with this content structure

    /content/
        mysite/
          @sling:config = /config/tenants/piedpiper
            page1
            page2
            sub/
              @sling:config = /config/tenants/piedpiper/sub
                pageA
                pageB
                
The context for "/content/mysite/page1" is "/config/tenants/piedpiper" while for "/content/mysite/sub/pageA" it is "/config/tenants/piedpiper/sub"

For "/content/mysite/page1" the implementation searches at these paths for a configuration resource named "socialmedia/facebook":
    /config/tenants/piedpiper/sling:configs/socialmedia/facebook
    /config/global/sling:configs/socialmedia/facebook
    /apps/sling:configs/socialmedia/facebook
    /libs/sling:configs/socialmedia/facebook

The first resource found at these locations is used, if none is found, no context aware resource will be returned.

For "/content/mysite/sub/pageA" the implementation searches at these paths for a configuration resource named "socialmedia/facebook"

    /config/tenants/piedpiper/sub/sling:configs/socialmedia/facebook
    /config/global/sling:configs/socialmedia/facebook
    /apps/sling:configs/socialmedia/facebook
    /libs/sling:configs/socialmedia/facebook

2.2 Content Model
=================

Configurations are stored under /config

    /config/
          global/
                 sling:configs/
                          socialmedia/
                                      youtube
                                             @enabled = false  <-  "enabled" is a property of the youtube resource, denoted by the @ prefix
                                             @url = https://youtube.com <-  "url" is a property of the youtube resource, denoted by the @ prefix
          tenants/   
                  piedpiper/
                            sling:configs/
                                     socialmedia/
                                                 facebook 
                                                      @enabled = true  <-  "enabled" is a property of the facebook resource, denoted by the @ prefix
                                                      @url = https://facebook.com <-  "url" is a property of the facebook resource, denoted by the @ prefix
