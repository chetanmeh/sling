config.name=Apache Sling Resource-Based Discovery Service Configuration
config.description = The configuration of the resource based discovery service implementation.

heartbeatTimeout.name = Heartbeat timeout (seconds)
heartbeatTimeout.description = Configure the timeout (in seconds) after which an instance is \
 considered dead/crashed. Default is 45 seconds.

heartbeatInterval.name = Heartbeat interval (seconds)
heartbeatInterval.description = Configure the interval (in seconds) according to which the \
 heartbeats are exchanged in the topology. Default is 15 seconds.

minEventDelay.name = Minimal Event Delay (seconds)
minEventDelay.description = Configure a minimal delay (in seconds) between TOPOLOGY_CHANGING \
 and TOPOLOGY_CHANGED. Any further changes happening during this delay are accumulated and \
 combined in the TOPOLOGY_CHANGED after this delay. THis helps avoiding event-flooding. \
 Default is 3 seconds. A negative value or zero disables this delay.

topologyConnectorUrls.name = Topology Connector URLs
topologyConnectorUrls.description = URLs where to join a topology, e.g. \
 http://localhost:4502/libs/sling/topology/connector

topologyConnectorWhitelist.name = Topology Connector Whitelist
topologyConnectorWhitelist.description = List of IPs and/or hostnames which are allowed to \
 connect to the connector URL.

discoveryResourcePath.name = Discovery Resource Path
discoveryResourcePath.description = Path of resource where to keep discovery information. \
 The default is /var/discovery/impl.

leaderElectionRepositoryDescriptor.name = Repository Descriptor Name
leaderElectionRepositoryDescriptor.description = Name of the repository descriptor to be taken \
 into account for leader election: those instances have preference to become leader which have \
 the corresponding descriptor value of 'false'.

autoStopLocalLoopEnabled.name = Enable Auto-Stop for Local-Loop Connectors
autoStopLocalLoopEnabled.description = If true, and the discovery.impl detects a local-looping \
 topology connector, the corresponding topology connector will be automatically stopped. \
 This is useful to prevent unnecessary loops with eg pre-configured topology connectors.

hmacEnabled.name = Enable Hmac message signatures
hmacEnabled.description = If true, and the Shared Key is set to the same value on all members of the \
 topology, the messages will be validated using a HMAC of a digest of the body of the message. \
 The hmac and message digest are in the HTTP request and response headers. Both requests and responses \
 are signed.

enableEncryption.name = Enable Message encryption
enableEncryption.description = If Message HMACs are enabled and there is a shared key set, setting this to \
 true will encrypt the body of the message using 128 bit AES encryption. Once encrypted you will not be able \
 debug the messages at the http level.

sharedKey.name = Message shared key.
sharedKey.description = If message signing and encryption is used, this should be set to the same value \
 on all members of the same topology. If any member of the topology has a different key it will effectively \
 be excluded from the topology even if it attempts to send messages to other members of the topology.

hmacSharedKeyTTL.name = Shared Key TTL
hmacSharedKeyTTL.description = Shared keys for message signatures are derived from the configured shared key. \
 Each derived key has a lifetime (TTL). Once that time has expired a new key is derived and used for hmac signatures. \
 This setting, sets the TTL in ms. Keys that are 2 lifetimes old are ignored. Set according to you level of paranoia, \
 but don't set to less than the greatest possible clock drift between members of the topology. The default is 4 hours. Setting \
 to a ridiculously low value will increase the turnover of keys. Generating a key takes about 2ms. There is no risk of \
 memory consumption with low values, only a risk of the topology falling apart due to incorrectly set clocks.
